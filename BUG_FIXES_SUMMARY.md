# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Missing Legal Pages
**Problem**: Footer links to `/privacy`, `/terms`, and `/cookies` returned 404 errors.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive legal pages:
- `src/app/privacy/page.tsx` - Privacy Policy with GDPR compliance details
- `src/app/terms/page.tsx` - Terms of Service with user agreements
- `src/app/cookies/page.tsx` - Cookie Policy with usage explanations

**Features**:
- Professional legal content
- Responsive design matching site theme
- Back navigation to home page
- Contact information for legal inquiries
- Proper SEO metadata

### 2. âœ… Non-functional "Learn More" Button
**Problem**: The "Learn More" button in the Hero section had no click handler.

**Solution**: Added smooth scroll functionality to the "How It Works" section:
```typescript
onClick={() => {
  const howItWorksSection = document.getElementById('how-it-works');
  howItWorksSection?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' });
}}
```

**Features**:
- Smooth scrolling animation
- Proper accessibility labels
- Works with existing section ID

### 3. âœ… Jittery Hover Animations
**Problem**: Button hover animations were causing visual jitter due to scale transforms.

**Solution**: Replaced scale-based animations with smoother alternatives:

**Before**:
```css
hover:scale-105 active:scale-95
```

**After**:
```css
hover:shadow-lg hover:shadow-amber-500/25 hover:-translate-y-0.5
active:translate-y-0 active:shadow-md
```

**Improvements**:
- Smooth vertical translation instead of scaling
- Enhanced shadow effects for depth
- GPU acceleration with `transform-gpu`
- Proper easing with `ease-in-out`
- Reduced motion support for accessibility

### 4. âœ… Non-functional "Get Started" Button in Callout Section
**Problem**: The "Get Started" button in the "How It Works" section only logged to console.

**Solution**: Implemented cross-component communication:
- Added custom event dispatch to scroll to top and open modal
- Added event listener in Hero component to handle modal opening
- Smooth scroll to top for better UX

### 5. âœ… Enhanced Global Button Styles
**Problem**: Inconsistent button animations across the site.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive button animation styles to `globals.css`:
```css
.smooth-button {
  @apply transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out;
  @apply transform-gpu will-change-transform;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
  -webkit-backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

**Features**:
- Prevents layout shift during animations
- Hardware acceleration for smooth performance
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Accessibility considerations

## Technical Improvements

### Performance Optimizations
- GPU acceleration for animations (`transform-gpu`)
- Hardware-accelerated properties (`will-change-transform`)
- Optimized transition durations (300ms for smooth feel)
- Backface visibility hidden to prevent flicker

### Accessibility Enhancements
- Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- Reduced motion support for users with vestibular disorders
